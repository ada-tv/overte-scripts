# Context Menu
* Optional description text for actions
* Confirmation menu type for convenience?
* A mode where submenus can have build actionsets built async at runtime, rather than in advance

# Leg Poser
* Create and delete handles as needed, rather than only at enable/disable time

# Avatar Grab
* Cartoon chomp noise on head grab
